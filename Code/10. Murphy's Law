### Following are the Murphy's law for computer programming.
** Anything that can go wrong will go wrong **
- Any given program, when running, is obsolete.
- If a program is useless, it will have to be documented.
- If a program is useful, it will have to be changed.
- Any non-trivial program contains at least one bug.
- Any program will expand to fill all available memory.
- The value of a program is directly proportional to the weight of its output.
- The complexity of a program will grow until it exceeds the capability of the programmer to maintain it.
- Make it possible for programmers to write in English and you will find that programmers cannot write in English.
- If builders built buildings the way programmers write programs, the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization.
- Inside every small program is a large program struggling to get out.
- If a test installation functions perfectly, all subsequent systems will malfunction.
- Not until a program has been in production for at least six months will its most harmful error be discovered.
- Undetectable errors are infinite in variety, in contrast to detectable errors, which are by definition limited.
- If the input editor has been designed to reject all bad input, an ingenious idiot will discover a method to get bad data past it.
- Build a system that even a fool can use, and only a fool will want to use it.
- Machines work; people should think.
- A carelessly planned project takes three times longer to complete than expected; a carefully planned project will take only twice as long.
- Adding manpower to a late project makes it later.
- The effort required to correct an error increases geometrically with time.
- Only ten percent of the code in any given program will ever be executed.
